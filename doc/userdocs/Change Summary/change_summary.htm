<h1>Purple Pen Change Summary</h1>
<h2>Changes in 1.0.0</h2>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p class=featurelist>The user interface of the program can be displayed in multiple languages. Use the File/Program Language
    command to change the language of the user interface. English, French, and 
	Swedish languages are provided.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p class=featurelist>Automatically generated textual control descriptions can be displayed or printed in different languages.
    To change the language for an event, use the Event/Customize Description Text command. 
	English, French, Swedish, and UK English are provided.</p>
    </li>
	<li>
    <p class=featurelist>Arbitrary text can be added to the map using Item/Add 
	Special Item/Text. This text can have special text in it that changes 
	depending on the course (e.g., $(CourseName) becomes the name of the 
	course). </p>
    </li>
	<li>
    <p class=featurelist>The new Event / Customize Course Appearance command can 
	be used to adjust the sizes of controls circles, lines, and control numbers. 
	It can also be used to change the shade of purple used for the course.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p class=featurelist>The event title, and the class list/secondary title, can have multiple lines in them. This is 
    especially useful for courses with many classes in them. When editing directly in the description pane, use vertical
    bar (|) to separate the lines.</p>
    </li>
	<li>
    <p class=featurelist>Overlapping control circles are automatically cut to 
	avoid the overlap (except on the All Controls display).</p>
   </li>
	<li>
    <p class=featurelist>In the initial start up window, you are now given a 
	choice (the default choice, in fact), to load the last file you were working 
	on.</p>
   </li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li><p class="featurelist"></p>Exported IOF XML (Create E-Punch Interface File) no longer contains the 
DOCTYPE declaration referencing the IOFdata.dtd file, since it caused problems 
with some programs.</p></li>
<li><p class="featurelist">Printing should be faster, especially in cases with large patterned area (e.g., open land with scattered trees), or printing multiple copies of the same map.</p></li>
<li><p class="featurelist">If the background map is changed while it is open 
(for example, the map is edited and saved in OCAD), Purple Pen will 
automatically reload the changed map file.</p></li>
<li><p class="featurelist">The AltGr key on some keyboards now works correctly 
when directly editing the title of an event or the dimensions in column F. Also, 
if you enter text here and then click outside the popup without pressing Enter, 
the entered text is used instead of discarded.</p></li>
<li><p class="featurelist">If the textual description for a control is too long 
to fit into two lines using the default font size, the font size is 
automatically shrunk so the description will fit.</p></li>
<li><p class="featurelist">Display of the margins and page size now is in mm 
when in a metric locale, instead of inches.</p></li>
</ul> 
<h2>Changes in 1.0.0 beta 3</h2>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">OCAD compatibility has been completed (to my knowledge). All OCAD symbols and options 
	should print and display correctly.</p> 
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">New command "Delete Unused Controls" on the Event menu allows easily deleting all controls
	in the All Controls collection that are not being used by any course.</p> </li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">New Event Audit report checks and reports on many possible problems, including unused controls,
	missing descriptions, controls less than 100m apart, missing punch patterns, and more.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">It is now possible to move control codes on the All 
	Controls display. To prevent errors, they must still be directly adjacent to 
	the associated circle.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">English description text is phrased better. Instead 
	of &quot;knoll, rocky, E side&quot;, you get &quot;E side of rocky knoll&quot;.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">Control gaps are now maintained separately for each 
	print scale. So if one course is at 1:15,000 and another is at 1:10,000, 
	then different gaps can be placed in the same control circle.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">Create OCAD Files now allows placing a prefix before 
	the course name for each file generated. Also, if files will be replaced, 
	you are warned about them.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">When creating a new event, you are now prompted for 
	the default printing scale. This becomes the printing scale for All Controls 
	as well as the default scale for new courses.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">You can change the print scale for All Controls by 
	choosing Course/Properties when the All Controls map is displayed. This 
	affects the size of circles on the All Controls map, as well as the scale 
	when printing the All Controls map.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">On some printers, dashed lines (such as paths) would 
	print without the dashes. On some printers, patterned areas like indistinct 
	marshes might print partially in the wrong color. These are fixed.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">If a leg had bends or gaps in it, and one of the controls on the end was deleted, an internal
	error could occur due to inconsistent data. This is fixed.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">Control codes that are a single letter or digit are now allowed.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">When creating OCAD files, characters in the course 
	name that are not allowed in file names are now correctly handled.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">Very occasionally on a few maps with short dry ditch 
	symbols, an OutOfMemoryException would occur at certain zoom levels. This should be 
	fixed now.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in 1.0.0 beta 2</h2>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">OCAD compatibility has been vastly enhanced. Almost 
	all OCAD symbols and options print and display correctly. The warning 
	message that used to display before printing courses has been removed, 
	because printing courses directly from Purple Pen now works correctly in 
	virtually all cases. In the cases where the OCAD map contains a symbol that 
	will not print correctly, Purple Pen detects in and displays a message 
	before printing indicating which symbol is affected.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">The menus have been somewhat rearranged to make the 
	layout more logical and make commands easier to find. In particular, there 
	are two new menus. The Event menu contains commands that affect the entire 
	event. The Item menu contains commands that affect the currently selected 
	item (control, start, finish, leg, special item). Other small changes have 
	occurred also.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">The new Item/Add Text Line command can be used to add 
	an arbitrary text line anywhere in the description sheet.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">The Create XML Interface File command has been 
	renamed Create E-Punch Interface File to reflect its primary usage.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">The Add Gap and Add Bend commands have toolbar 
	buttons and keyboard shortcuts for them.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">New command: Event/Map File, which allows changing the associated map file 
after the event is created.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">If the map file cannot be found when the Purple Pen file is opened, a useful 
error message is shown and the user is prompted to find the map file.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">Map files can now be bitmap files as well as OCAD files. The supported bitmap 
file formats are TIFF, JPEG, BMP, GIF, and PNG. When you export courses to OCAD, 
the bitmap becomes a template (background map) for the OCAD course.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">If an OCAD map file contains a font that is not 
	installed on the current computer, the user is warned about this when the 
	event is loaded. If desired, the warning can then be turned off for the 
	event.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">Based on feedback, the control descriptions on the map now appear in black 
(previously they appeared in purple).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">Added &quot;Leg Lengths&quot; report to the Reports menu. This shows the lengths of 
each leg on each course, as well as the average leg length for each course.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">Added &quot;Customize Descriptions&quot; to the Controls menu. This dialog allows you 
to change the English text associated with any of the symbols. This is 
especially useful for the special item symbols. You can also add a key at the 
bottom of description to show what the special item symbols denote.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">The order of courses can be specified by using the Course/Course Order 
command. By default, courses are displayed in the order in which you added them 
(instead of alphabetically as before).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">When adding a new control, if no control or leg is 
	selected, the control is inserted in the nearest leg (instead of at the end 
	of the course). When adding a new control, or moving a control, the 
	connecting leg lines are shown to provide better feedback as to what will 
	happen.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">When adding a new control to a course, a control 
	already in the existing course can be chosen, so that butterfly-style 
	courses can be easily created.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">The &quot;abbreviate in text&quot; option for printing control 
	descriptions has been removed, as it added complexity with minimal benefit.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">A new &quot;Clear Selection&quot; command (keyboard shortcut: 
	Esc) clears the selection on the current course. Clicking on nothing 
	accomplishes the same thing.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">When starting Purple Pen, a new option allows loading 
	the sample event, so people using the program for the first time can get a 
	sense of how it works. This file also is placed in a different location on 
	install.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">32x32 icon was empty. Now the correct Purple Pen icon 
	is there -- used for desktop shortcuts, for example. You may need to rebuild 
	your Windows icon cache for this to show up if you installed an older 
	version of Purple Pen. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">When textual (or text &amp; symbols) descriptions are 
	placed on the map, one line descriptions are now correctly centered 
	vertically in the box.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">The map intensity reverted to full after printing. It 
	doesn&#39;t do that any more. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">Mandatory crossing points are now shown in the all 
	controls map.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">In score courses, the finish could not be selected or 
	moved. This is fixed.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">OCAD files that had a template (background map) with 
	non-ASCII characters (accented letters) would not load.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">Files from OCAD 5 and earlier are now detected and 
	give a useful error message (but they still won&#39;t load).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">Many cases of symbols not displaying like they do in 
	OCAD (some major, some minor) are fixed.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">Symbol &quot;fragments&quot; created when doing a &quot;To Graphics&quot; 
	in OCAD 9 now display.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">Creating OCAD files in OCAD 7 format did not write 
	the template information correctly; now fixed.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
