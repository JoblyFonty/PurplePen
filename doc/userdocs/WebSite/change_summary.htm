<h1>Purple Pen Change Summary</h1>
<h2>Changes in 2.0.0 beta 2</h2>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            When the program crashes or encounters an unhandled exception, an option is provided
            to send a detailed crash report to the developer to use to help find and fix the problem.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Trying to add descriptions to "All Parts" of a course with a map exchange now gives a message 
            explaining what to do, rather than just disabling the command.
            (Thanks to Bruce Marshall for feedback on this.)
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            If the Arial Narrow Regular font was missing, but Arial Narrow Bold was not, the program would crash.
            (Thanks to Lukas Janusauskas for reporting this.)
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Arrow keys now work correctly for moving around the map.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The text on the all controls description that indicated the number of controls always appeared in English,
            instead of using the language of the description. (Thanks to Christopher Schive for bringing this to my attention.)
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes in 2.0.0 beta 1</h2>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
    Full support for map exchanges. You can add a map exchange either at a control, or with a 
    flagged route to a map exchange point. Purple Pen allows you to view either parts of the course,
    or the entire course, and creates partial or full control descriptions, as appropriate. You can 
    set a different print area for each part of a course with a map exchange, although all 
    parts must be on the same map file. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
    Multi-column descriptions on the map. If the control description won’t fit well in a single 
    column on the map, you can change the shape of the description to appear in multiple columns.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
    The "all controls" map can have a description sheet placed on it with descriptions for all the controls.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
    When you hover over a control or leg on the map, a small popup appears with information 
    about the control or leg. This can be turned on or off with the "View/Show Popup Information" menu item.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
    On Windows Vista and later, printing has been completely revamped to use a vector-based printing model. This should 
    result in smaller spool files, faster printing, and better PDF creation when used with a 
    PDF print driver. You can switch back to the old method (in case of problems) by 
    checking the "Rasterize Before Printing" check box in the Print Courses dialog. (On Windows XP, 
    the Rasterize Before Printing option is always on and cannot be disabled).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
    The program now uses the "CMYK" (cyan-magenta-yellow-black) color model by default 
    when printing or displaying on the screen. This should mean that maps print with colors
     much closer to what the map creator intended, and similar to how OCAD prints them on a
     PostScript printer. When printing, you now have the option of using the "CMYK" color 
    model (the new default), the “RGB” printing model (how Purple Pen 1.x did it), or "OCAD Compatible". 
    The "OCAD Compatible" model should produce the same output as OCAD does on the same printer. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
    Score courses can have the controls labeled with the number of points for the 
    control (along with the control number or code). 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gaps in control circles are now much better and more like gaps in a leg. You can drag a gap of any
size and adjust the size of a gap after it is created. You can now add a small (2mm) gap in a leg by just
clicking after selecting the add gap command.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide the option of a center dot for controls in Event/Customize Course Appearance. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add $(PrintScale) to the special text options for Text special items. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
    You can drag the map around with the left mouse button as well as the right mouse button.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
    For clarity, the "Create EPunch Interface File" menu item has been renamed 
    to "Create Data Interchange File (IOF XML)".
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
    When a new version is available for download, provides the option to automatically 
    download and install the new version. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
    The setup program is redone. This shouldn't make a large difference, 
    but hopefully will be more reliable.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
    Class names (from the secondary title/class name for a course) are now 
    exported to the IOF XML. This should improve compatibility with some other software.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
    The program now uses the .NET Framework 4.0 instead of the .NET Framework 2.0. 
    The setup program will automatically download and install the new version if necessary. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2>Changes in 1.1.0 </h2>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fully supports reading and creating OCAD 10 files, including all new symbol 
and object features. </p>
</li>
	<li>
	<p>The new "Create RouteGadget Files..." command on the File menu 
	automatically creates both a .GIF format image of the map (appropriately 
	cropped with the correct resolution) along with an .XML file, for use in 
	RouteGadget.</p>
</li>
	<li>
	<p>You can specify the number of the first control in a course in the 
Course/New or Course/Properties command. The number is typically 1, but you can 
set it to another value as a way to handle multi-part courses and other special 
situations.</p>
</li>
	<li>
	<p>You can specify the style to print the labels on control circles -- the 
	usual sequence number, the control code, or both (e.g., "4-234"). Thanks to 
	Andy Simpson for contributing code for this feature.</p>
</li>
	<li>
	<p>For score courses, you can specify which column the points for each 
	control is displayed in: column, A, B, H, or not displayed at all.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When a font cannot be found, and bold and/or italic was specified, uses
the bold and/or italic version of Arial (matching OCAD's behavior), instead of the
non-bold, non-italic Arial.</p>
</li>
	<li>
	<p>Fixed a bug that would result in OutOfMemoryException when drawing 
	certain OCAD maps.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in 1.0.2 </h2>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A new special item has been added: white out area, which can be added like 
other special items (such on out of bounds area). The white out area blanks out 
the underlying map.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Made more resilient in opening OCAD files with malformed or unexpected data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in 1.0.1 </h2>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fixed a problem that prevented loading certain OCAD files with mismatched 
objects/symbols.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Text special items that were empty caused an exception.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in 1.0.0 </h2>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In certain cases, trying to place a text object that was empty would cause an 
exception. This is fixed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OCAD text objects which had a newline at the very beginning drew one line too 
low compared to OCAD (for no apparent reason, OCAD ignores an initial newline in 
a text object.) Purple Pen now matches OCAD&#39;s behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed the appearance of some dialog windows when running with &quot;Large Fonts&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some arrow characters didn&#39;t appear in a vanilla XP installation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Swedish and French translations updated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in 1.0.0 RC1</h2>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p class=featurelist>The user interface of the program can be displayed in multiple languages. Use the File/Program Language
    command to change the language of the user interface. English, French, and 
	Swedish languages are provided.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p class=featurelist>Automatically generated textual control descriptions can be displayed or printed in different languages.
    To change the language for an event, use the Event/Customize Description Text command. 
	English, French, Swedish, and UK English are provided.</p>
    </li>
	<li>
    <p class=featurelist>By default, when printing the map is cropped to fit on 
	a single page. In most cases, this means you don&#39;t have to set the print 
	area manually, since Purple Pen intelligently crops to fit the course best 
	on the page. If you want you can still print a map across multiple pages.</p>
    </li>
	<li>
    <p class=featurelist>Arbitrary text can be added to the map using Item/Add 
	Special Item/Text. This text can have special text in it that changes 
	depending on the course (e.g., $(CourseName) becomes the name of the 
	course). </p>
    </li>
	<li>
    <p class=featurelist>The new Event / Customize Course Appearance command can 
	be used to adjust the sizes of controls circles, lines, and control numbers. 
	It can also be used to change the shade of purple used for the course.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p class=featurelist>The event title, and the class list/secondary title, can have multiple lines in them. This is 
    especially useful for courses with many classes in them. When editing directly in the description pane, use vertical
    bar (|) to separate the lines.</p>
    </li>
	<li>
    <p class=featurelist>Overlapping control circles are automatically cut to 
	avoid the overlap (except on the All Controls display).</p>
   </li>
	<li>
    <p class=featurelist>In the initial start up window, you are now given a 
	choice (the default choice, in fact), to load the last file you were working 
	on.</p>
   </li>
	<li>
    <p class=featurelist>Dialog windows now use a nicer looking and slightly 
	bigger font.</p>
   </li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li><p class="featurelist">Problems loading or drawing certain OCAD files have 
been fixed.</p></li><li><p class="featurelist">Exported IOF XML (Create E-Punch Interface File) no longer contains the 
DOCTYPE declaration referencing the IOFdata.dtd file, since it caused problems 
with some programs.</p></li>
<li><p class="featurelist">Printing should be faster, especially in cases with large patterned area (e.g., open land with scattered trees), or printing multiple copies of the same map.</p></li>
<li><p class="featurelist">If the background map is changed while it is open 
(for example, the map is edited and saved in OCAD), Purple Pen will 
automatically reload the changed map file.</p></li>
<li><p class="featurelist">The AltGr key on some keyboards now works correctly 
when directly editing the title of an event or the dimensions in column F. Also, 
if you enter text here and then click outside the popup without pressing Enter, 
the entered text is used instead of discarded.</p></li>
<li><p class="featurelist">If the textual description for a control is too long 
to fit into two lines using the default font size, the font size is 
automatically shrunk so the description will fit.</p></li>
<li><p class="featurelist">Display of the margins and page size now is in mm 
when in a metric locale, instead of inches.</p></li>
</ul> 
<h2>Changes in 1.0.0 beta 3</h2>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">OCAD compatibility has been completed (to my knowledge). All OCAD symbols and options 
	should print and display correctly.</p> 
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">New command "Delete Unused Controls" on the Event menu allows easily deleting all controls
	in the All Controls collection that are not being used by any course.</p> </li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">New Event Audit report checks and reports on many possible problems, including unused controls,
	missing descriptions, controls less than 100m apart, missing punch patterns, and more.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">It is now possible to move control codes on the All 
	Controls display. To prevent errors, they must still be directly adjacent to 
	the associated circle.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">English description text is phrased better. Instead 
	of &quot;knoll, rocky, E side&quot;, you get &quot;E side of rocky knoll&quot;.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">Control gaps are now maintained separately for each 
	print scale. So if one course is at 1:15,000 and another is at 1:10,000, 
	then different gaps can be placed in the same control circle.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">Create OCAD Files now allows placing a prefix before 
	the course name for each file generated. Also, if files will be replaced, 
	you are warned about them.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">When creating a new event, you are now prompted for 
	the default printing scale. This becomes the printing scale for All Controls 
	as well as the default scale for new courses.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">You can change the print scale for All Controls by 
	choosing Course/Properties when the All Controls map is displayed. This 
	affects the size of circles on the All Controls map, as well as the scale 
	when printing the All Controls map.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">On some printers, dashed lines (such as paths) would 
	print without the dashes. On some printers, patterned areas like indistinct 
	marshes might print partially in the wrong color. These are fixed.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">If a leg had bends or gaps in it, and one of the controls on the end was deleted, an internal
	error could occur due to inconsistent data. This is fixed.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">Control codes that are a single letter or digit are now allowed.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">When creating OCAD files, characters in the course 
	name that are not allowed in file names are now correctly handled.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">Very occasionally on a few maps with short dry ditch 
	symbols, an OutOfMemoryException would occur at certain zoom levels. This should be 
	fixed now.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in 1.0.0 beta 2</h2>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">OCAD compatibility has been vastly enhanced. Almost 
	all OCAD symbols and options print and display correctly. The warning 
	message that used to display before printing courses has been removed, 
	because printing courses directly from Purple Pen now works correctly in 
	virtually all cases. In the cases where the OCAD map contains a symbol that 
	will not print correctly, Purple Pen detects in and displays a message 
	before printing indicating which symbol is affected.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">The menus have been somewhat rearranged to make the 
	layout more logical and make commands easier to find. In particular, there 
	are two new menus. The Event menu contains commands that affect the entire 
	event. The Item menu contains commands that affect the currently selected 
	item (control, start, finish, leg, special item). Other small changes have 
	occurred also.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">The new Item/Add Text Line command can be used to add 
	an arbitrary text line anywhere in the description sheet.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">The Create XML Interface File command has been 
	renamed Create E-Punch Interface File to reflect its primary usage.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">The Add Gap and Add Bend commands have toolbar 
	buttons and keyboard shortcuts for them.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">New command: Event/Map File, which allows changing the associated map file 
after the event is created.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">If the map file cannot be found when the Purple Pen file is opened, a useful 
error message is shown and the user is prompted to find the map file.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">Map files can now be bitmap files as well as OCAD files. The supported bitmap 
file formats are TIFF, JPEG, BMP, GIF, and PNG. When you export courses to OCAD, 
the bitmap becomes a template (background map) for the OCAD course.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">If an OCAD map file contains a font that is not 
	installed on the current computer, the user is warned about this when the 
	event is loaded. If desired, the warning can then be turned off for the 
	event.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">Based on feedback, the control descriptions on the map now appear in black 
(previously they appeared in purple).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">Added &quot;Leg Lengths&quot; report to the Reports menu. This shows the lengths of 
each leg on each course, as well as the average leg length for each course.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">Added &quot;Customize Descriptions&quot; to the Controls menu. This dialog allows you 
to change the English text associated with any of the symbols. This is 
especially useful for the special item symbols. You can also add a key at the 
bottom of description to show what the special item symbols denote.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">The order of courses can be specified by using the Course/Course Order 
command. By default, courses are displayed in the order in which you added them 
(instead of alphabetically as before).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">When adding a new control, if no control or leg is 
	selected, the control is inserted in the nearest leg (instead of at the end 
	of the course). When adding a new control, or moving a control, the 
	connecting leg lines are shown to provide better feedback as to what will 
	happen.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">When adding a new control to a course, a control 
	already in the existing course can be chosen, so that butterfly-style 
	courses can be easily created.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">The &quot;abbreviate in text&quot; option for printing control 
	descriptions has been removed, as it added complexity with minimal benefit.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">A new &quot;Clear Selection&quot; command (keyboard shortcut: 
	Esc) clears the selection on the current course. Clicking on nothing 
	accomplishes the same thing.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">When starting Purple Pen, a new option allows loading 
	the sample event, so people using the program for the first time can get a 
	sense of how it works. This file also is placed in a different location on 
	install.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">32x32 icon was empty. Now the correct Purple Pen icon 
	is there -- used for desktop shortcuts, for example. You may need to rebuild 
	your Windows icon cache for this to show up if you installed an older 
	version of Purple Pen. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">When textual (or text &amp; symbols) descriptions are 
	placed on the map, one line descriptions are now correctly centered 
	vertically in the box.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">The map intensity reverted to full after printing. It 
	doesn&#39;t do that any more. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">Mandatory crossing points are now shown in the all 
	controls map.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="featurelist">In score courses, the finish could not be selected or 
	moved. This is fixed.</p>
