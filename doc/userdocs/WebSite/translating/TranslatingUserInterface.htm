<h1>Translating the User Interface</h1>
<p>Purple Pen uses a web-based service called LaunchPad to translate the user 
interface. LaunchPad allows many people to collaborate on translating pieces of 
text in the program. You must create a free account on LaunchPad to contribute 
translations.</p>
<p>First, go to the <a href="https://translations.launchpad.net/purple-pen">
LaunchPad translation page for Purple Pen</a>:</p>
<p>
<img alt="Screen 1" src="screen1.png" width="782" height="644" class="style1" /></p>
<p>Click on the &quot;Log in / Register&quot; link, and follow the instructions to create 
a new account. Once you have completed getting a new account and finished 
logging in, click the ling &quot;Select Languages...&quot; link inside the &quot;Your 
languages&quot; box. From the very very long list of languages presented, select the 
language(s) you would like to translate Purple Pen into, and click Save.</p>
<p>The main translation page will now show just the language(s) you selected. 
For example, if you selected French, the following would appear within the main 
translation page:</p>
<p>
<img alt="screen 2" src="screen2.png" width="647" height="407" class="style1" /></p>
<p>Click the name of the language to go to the translation page.</p>
