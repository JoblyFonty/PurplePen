<h1>File/Print Courses...</h1>

<p>Prints the courses and underlying OCAD map onto a printer. By default, the 
entire map will be printed. To chose the area that will be printed, use the
<a href="FileSetPrintArea.htm">File/Set Print Area</a> command.</p>
<p>Note: Purple Pen prints almost all OCAD map symbols exactly as OCAD would 
print them. If Purple Pen encounters a <a href="UnsupportedSymbols.htm">symbol 
in the OCAD map that it cannot print correctly</a>, then it will display a 
dialog listing the symbols that will be printed correctly.</p>

<p>This dialog has several options to customize the result of printing.</p>
<h2>Output section</h2>
<p>This section shows which printer will be used, and the paper size. Click <strong>Change Printer</strong> 
to change which printer to use. In that dialog, click Preferences to change the 
paper size and other printing options. The orientation of the paper (portrait or 
landscape) is chosen automatically to fit the best. </p>
<h2>Courses section</h2>
<p>This section shows which courses will be 
printed. The default setting is for all courses except &quot;All Controls&quot; to be 
printed. Click the checkboxes next to the courses you wish to print. Click
<strong>All</strong> or <strong>None</strong> to quickly select or unselect all 
of the checkboxes at once.</p>
<h2>Copies section</h2>
<p>This section determines how many copies of each course will be printed. </p>
<h2>Appearance section</h2>
<p>This section determines what happens if the <a href="FileSetPrintArea.htm">
print area</a> is too large to fit on a single sheet of paper. Crop to a single 
page (the default) will pick the portion of the map that best covers that 
course. Print on multiple pages will print multiple pages of maps to cover the 
entire print area.</p>
<h2>Other buttons</h2>
<p><strong>Print</strong>: This button prints the courses on the selected 
printer. The dialog box closes.</p>
<p><strong>Preview: </strong>Opens a print preview dialog box that shows what 
will be printed. </p>
<p><strong>Cancel</strong>: Closes the dialog box without printing anything.</p>
