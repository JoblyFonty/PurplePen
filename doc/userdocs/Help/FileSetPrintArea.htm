<h1>File/Set Print Area</h1>

<p>The Set Print Area command sets the area of the map that will be printed when
<a href="FilePrintCourses.htm">printing courses</a>. If you do not set the print 
area, the entire map will be printed. If you <a href="FileCreateOcadFiles.htm">
create an OCAD file from a course</a>, the print area becomes the default print 
area in the resulting OCAD file.</p>
<p>There are two sub-commands: either This Course or All Courses. Just as they 
sound, selecting &quot;This Course&quot; sets the print area for the currently displayed 
course, selecting &quot;All Courses&quot; changes the print area for all the courses. 
(Note: if All Controls is displayed, doing Set Print Area/This Course sets the 
print area for when the control collection is printed.)</p>
<p>After selecting the desired sub-command, the current print area is 
highlighted in red, and a small window appears:</p>
<p>
<img alt="Set Print Area dialog" src="SetPrintArea.png" width="207" height="155"> </p>
<p>The displayed print area has small blue squares at each corner and along each 
edge. These squares are used to resize the print area: press the left mouse 
button over one of these squares, hold down the mouse button, and drag the 
corner or edge to the desired location. While changing the print area, you can 
also <a href="Moving%20around.htm">move and zoom the map</a> as usual.</p>
<p>Once the print area is correct, click the &quot;Done&quot; button in the Set Print Area 
window.</p>
