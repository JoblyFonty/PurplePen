<h1>Event / Customize Course Appearance</h1>
<p>The Customize Course Appearance command allows changing the appearance of the 
drawn course. Changes affect the live display, printed courses, and courses 
exported to OCAD.</p>
<p>
<img alt="Customize Course Appearance Dialog" src="CustomizeCourseAppearance.png"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following items allow you to customize the appearance of the course. The 
&quot;Preview&quot; section shows a preview of what those changes will look like.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Use IOF standard sizes</strong>: If this is checked, Purple Pen uses 
the IOF standard sizes for control circles, legs, control numbers, and other 
items on the course. To change those sizes, uncheck this option.</p>
<p><strong>Control circle diameter</strong>: Set the outside diameter of control 
circles to the given size in mm. This also affects the size of the start 
triangle, finish circle, crossing points, refreshment marking, and first aid 
markings, which will be scaled in the same ratio. The IOF standard is 6.0 mm.</p>
<p><strong>Line width</strong>: Sets the width of lines for legs, control 
circles, start triangle, and the finish circle. The IOF standard is 0.35 mm.</p>
    <p><strong>Center dot diameter</strong>: If set to something higher than 0.00m (the IOF standard), places a dot of the indicated diameter in the center of the control circle. Although not typically used, it is useful for certain types of maps.</p>
<p><strong>Control number height</strong>: Sets the height of digits used for 
control numbers. The IOF standard is 4.0 mm.</p>
    <p><strong>Control number style</strong>: Determines if the control number is regular or boldface. The IOF standard is regular.</p>
    <p><strong>White outline around numbers</strong>: If greater than zero, a white outline of the given width is placed around numbers to make them more visible against colored or complex backgrounds.
    A value between 0.1mm and 0.4mm usually works best.</p>
    <p><strong>Automatic leg gap size</strong>: If greater than zero, controls how much of a gap to automatically place when one leg crosses another leg. Set this to zero to disable placing automatic gaps in legs.</p>
<p><strong>Use purple color from map</strong>: If this is checked, the color 
used for the course will be the same shade of Purple as used in the underlying 
OCAD map. If an image is used instead of an OCAD map, or the Purple color cannot 
be determined, a default purple color is used. Uncheck this to specify the 
purple color directly.</p>
<p><strong>Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black</strong>: Specifies the percentages of 
each pigment used to create the purple color, from 0 to 100.</p>
    <p><strong>Control Descriptions, Color</strong>: Specifies whether control descriptions on the map are displayed in black or purple. The default is black.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> the sizes of control circles and other feature are 
calculated based on the scale the map will be printed at. If the circles appear 
too large or too small, it is likely that the <a href="EventMapFile.htm">map 
scale</a> or <a href="CourseProperties.htm">print scale</a> is set incorrectly, 
or (if an image file is used for the map) the <a href="EventMapFile.htm">dots 
per inch</a> of the image is set incorrectly. This type of error will likely result in the length of the courses being calculated incorrectly as well, so it is highly recommended to fix the scale or dots per inch instead of adjusting the circle sizes.</p>
