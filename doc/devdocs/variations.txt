Big things to do before first beta:

- Add report for calculating teams assignment to variations.

- XML export for variations

- Allow viewing of variations in UI for course selection. Review all places where that UI is used. At least for printing/PDF export/description printing, etc.

- limit total permutations (maybe 10,000)

- switch to ordering view after add variation operation.



Variation naming issues:
    - UI to change variation naming. I think this is useful. Simple options: Variation code (default) or name+number or team/participant; include course name first.

    - What to show in course name field in description? Variation code, other code, team/participant number  Affects special text?

    - CourseView property for variation code, show in selection describer. Maybe variation name also?

    - special text for variation code, (variation name), team/participant number.

    - put into XML export too.



Minor issues to check/add later.

- clicking in topology view on legs too fiddly -- should allow more distance from pointer to leg.

- Text lines above/below -- how do these work with variations and with butterfly courses

- Allow insertion allows in different places on the same leg when splitting/joining.

- If fork ends at finish, no way to add controls after the fork. Prohibit such forks? Allow dragging in topology only?

- Loop control with start as the loop. Should this be allowed? Would this be a map change, or should you have to insert a map change at control? Needs some thinking here. 

- SelectionDescriber -- show what variations a control or leg is in. I'm not sure this is that useful.


- check out other reports -- in particular leg length, control&leg load, audit 
  (audit should check for some control two in a row, empty fork or loop, identical fork or loop, for example)
