
- Allow starting team number to be changed

- Allow variation choices to be manually assigned.

- Loop control with start as the loop. Should this be allowed? Would this be a map change, or should you have to insert a map change at control? Needs some thinking here. 



- GPX tracks.

- Text lines above/below -- how do these work with variations and with butterfly courses



- check out other reports -- in particular audit 
  (audit should check for some control two in a row, reversed legs  --- others? empty fork or loop, identical fork or loop, for example)
  
Probably won't do:  
  
- SelectionDescriber -- show what variations a control or leg is in. I'm not sure this is that useful.
