Things to worry about for variations:

- Text lines above/below -- how do these work with variations and with butterfly courses
- Add report for calculating teams assignment to variations.
- XML export for variations
- Allow viewing of variations in UI for course selection. Review all places where that UI is used.
- Allow per-variation specials? Probably not worth it.

- ChangeEvent.DuplicateCourse

- remove a course control that starts a fork/loop -- prompt user whether to remove the fork/loop and all controls on it.
