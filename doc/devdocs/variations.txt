Things to worry about for variations:

- show variation letters on the topology view. Have them be in order left to right.

- topology view scaling, scroll bar.

- UI to delete loop/fork. All loops/forks, or just this one.

- Text lines above/below -- how do these work with variations and with butterfly courses

- Add report for calculating teams assignment to variations.

- XML export for variations

- Allow viewing of variations in UI for course selection. Review all places where that UI is used.

- Length -- need to calculate range across all variations.

- remove a course control that starts a fork/loop -- prompt user whether to remove the fork/loop and all controls on it.

- When moving number on loop control, move for all loops variations. Not for forks, though.

- All Variations: distance field in COurseView -- should it be set; probably not. Or should there be a range?

- What to show in course name field in description?

- Loop control with start as the loop. Should this be allowed? This would be a map change, right?

- SelectionDescriber -- show what variations a control or leg is in.

- UI to change variation naming (do we need this? I'm not sure. Maybe instead have team/)

- better icon for add variation

- flicker when dragging number/controls in course view.

- check out other reports -- in particular leg length, control&leg load, audit 
  (audit should check for some control two in a row, empty fork or loop, identical fork or loop, for example)
