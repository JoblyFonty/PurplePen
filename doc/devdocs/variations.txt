Big things to do before first beta:

- Allow creating variation when leg is selected.

- tooltips on ordering view don't disappear well, I think.

- After adding variation, make sure next added control goes into one of the legs.

- Allow starting team number to be changed

- Allow variation choices to be manually assigned.


Minor issues to check/add later.

- GPX tracks.

- Text lines above/below -- how do these work with variations and with butterfly courses

- Allow variation that doesn't join. How to end it?

- Loop control with start as the loop. Should this be allowed? Would this be a map change, or should you have to insert a map change at control? Needs some thinking here. 

- SelectionDescriber -- show what variations a control or leg is in. I'm not sure this is that useful.


- check out other reports -- in particular leg length, control&leg load, audit 
  (audit should check for some control two in a row, empty fork or loop, identical fork or loop, for example)
