Things to worry about for variations:

- UI to add loop/fork
- UI to delete loop/fork. All loops/forks, or just this one.
- UI to change variation naming (do we need this? I'm not sure. Maybe instead have team/)
- Text lines above/below -- how do these work with variations and with butterfly courses
- Add report for calculating teams assignment to variations.
- XML export for variations
- Allow viewing of variations in UI for course selection. Review all places where that UI is used.
- Allow per-variation specials? Probably not worth it.
- Length -- need to calculate range across all variations.

- remove a course control that starts a fork/loop -- prompt user whether to remove the fork/loop and all controls on it.

- When moving number on loop control, move for all loops variations. Not for forks, though.

- How to deal with climb. Have per-variation climb? Probably not.

- All Variations: distance field in COurseView -- should it be set; probably not. Or should there be a range?

- What to show in course name field in description?

- Loop control with start as the loop. Should this be allowed? This would be a map change, right?

- SelectionDescriber -- show what variations a control or leg is in.

- Maybe. Add topology view. Would this replace the map, the description pane, or something else. This is a lot of work.
