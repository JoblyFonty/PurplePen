Things to worry about for variations:

- topology view scaling, scroll bar.

- UI to delete loop/fork. All loops/forks, or just this one.

- Text lines above/below -- how do these work with variations and with butterfly courses

- Add report for calculating teams assignment to variations.

- XML export for variations

- Allow viewing of variations in UI for course selection. Review all places where that UI is used. At least for printing/PDF export/description printing, etc.

- remove a course control that starts a fork/loop -- prompt user whether to remove the fork/loop and all controls on it.

- When moving number on loop control, move for all loops variations. Not for forks, though.

Variation naming issues:
    - What to show in course name field in description? Variation code, other code, team/participant number  Affects special text?

    - UI to change variation naming (do we need this? I'm not sure. )

    - CourseView property for variation code, show in selection describer. Maybe variation name also?

    - special text for variation code, (variation name), team/participant number.

- Loop control with start as the loop. Should this be allowed? This would be a map change, right?

- SelectionDescriber -- show what variations a control or leg is in. I'm not sure this is that useful.

- better icon for add variation

- flicker when dragging number/controls in course view.

- check out other reports -- in particular leg length, control&leg load, audit 
  (audit should check for some control two in a row, empty fork or loop, identical fork or loop, for example)
