Places that may need updating for multi-part courses:

QueryEvent.FindClosestLeg -- take a part?
AddControlMode.GetControlInsertionPoint -- return SelectionDescription instead of course id?
Controller.GetCurrentPrintArea -- should handle print area for just active part.
Controller.EndSetPrintArea -- should set print area just for active part? Is this an option?
Controller.BeginAddDescriptionMode -- handle adding description for a single part.
AddControlMode -- take CourseDesignator instead of CourseId?
CourseView.CreateFilteredAllControlsView -- take course designators instead of course ids?

Specials -- support specials in a single part.

Look at references to CourseView.BaseCourseId -- should they be CourseDesignators instead?
Check out "UNDONE MAPEXCHANGE" comments.

Prohibit adding map exchange to score course.

status text when adding map exchange -- 3 options: existing map exchange, new map exchange, map exchange at control

Allow adding start or finish to course part that shouldn't include that?
