Support for Open Orienteering Mapper. Purple Pen now allows an Open Orienteering Mapper file (.xmap or .omap) to be used as the base map for course design. You can also export your course designs to a new Open Orienteering Mapper file. All Open Orienteering Mapper maps should display as they appear in OOM. Georeferenced OOM files are supported only if they use the UTM coordinate system (this restriction may be relaxed in future versions).

Support for course variations and relays. You can now add forks or loops into courses, creating courses with variations. For example, a course might have two 2-way forks in a row, allowing four possible ways through the course. Each course variation is identified with a letter code that identifies which forks are taken. In the previous example, "AD" would indication that choice A is taken at the first fork, and choice D at the second fork. In order to view the variations more easily, the left side of the Purple Pen display (that normally shows the control descriptions), can be switched to show the control ordering, with forks displayed. Controls can be dragged around the ordering, and controls and legs can be easily selected for adding new controls. In order to create a variation, select a control, then click "Add Variation" on the toolbar. You can chose whether to add a fork or loop, and how many branches to create.

When you have a course with variations, Purple Pen can automatically assign variations to relay team members. Chose "Relay  Team Variations" from the Course menu, and chose how many legs and teams you have. You can later add more teams without disrupting the assignments of existing teams, as long as the number and arrangement of forks doesn't change.

When printing (courses, description sheets, punch cards), you can chose which variations or teams to print.

When using a PDF file as the base map for course design, Purple Pen no longer requires the download of GPL Ghostscript for reading PDF files. Purple Pen now has built in support for reading PDFs, based on the open source PDFium project used by Google Chrome. Compatibility is much better, especially for PDFs produced by OCAD.

The Item menu has been reorganized, and the items that add items have been moved to a new "Add" menu.
